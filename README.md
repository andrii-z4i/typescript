How to run this project locally
###

1. Install node and npm over here https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm
1. Visit http://www.developerhandbook.com/typescript/writing-angularjs-1-x-with-typescript/ and read the full "how to"
1. Here in the project I'm not using "tsd". Use typings insted. https://github.com/typings/typings 
1. In my case I've run typings with dt as a source and saved it globally (typings install dt~mocha --global --save)
1. I build all *.ts into one under build directory and enable mapping to debug it through web tools
